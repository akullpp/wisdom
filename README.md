# Whatever works for me at this stage

Read often.

Write down regularly.

Re-evaluate at intervals.

## A little bit of everything

* Take the stairs.

* Actual costs are often twice the listed price.

* Free or used books have the same words as new ones.

* Buy a tourist guidebook to your home town or region.

* Don't wait in line, it's rarely worth it.

* Be consciously inflexible with minor things like clothing, so you can be more flexible where it's important.

* Insurance companies are not on your side.

* The more you give, the more you get.

* Health is the most important asset you have.

* Restrictions are good, they will give you freedom.

* Be frugal no matter how much you think you have.

## About growing

* Just getting older is not an achievement.

* If you are alive, that means you still have lessons to learn.

* If you don't write it down, you will forget it.

* Your growth as a conscious being is the number of uncomfortable conversations you are willing to have.

* Don't keep making the same mistakes; try to make new mistakes.

* It is easier to change your thinking by changing your behavior than vice versa.

* You often do easy things to avoid the hard things.

* That thing that made you weird, could make you great.

* You are what you do, not what you tell or think you are.

* What you consume and spend your time on influences your thoughts and behavior.

* What you do on your bad days matters more than what you do on your good days.

* Read more books. Literature at best. Self-help at worst.

* Copying others is a good way to start but not to end.

## About the importance of continuity

* Consistency is more important than quantity.

* Average returns sustained over an above-average period of time yield extraordinary results.

* A long game will compound small gains to overcome even big mistakes.

* We tend to overestimate what we can do in a day, and underestimate what we can achieve in a decade.

* Focus on directions rather than destinations.

* Good things happen slowly, bad things happen fast.

## How to deal with others

* Treating a person to a meal never fails.

* Forgiveness is not something we do for others; it is a gift to ourselves.

* Hate is the poison you drink and hope that someone else might die.

* Accept compliments, don't deflect them.

* You can't reason someone who can't reason.

* Being extremely polite to rude people is the best response.

* Getting cheated occasionally is a small price, because when you trust, they generally treat you best.

* Don't treat people as bad as they are. Treat them as good as you are.

* You see only a small part of another person, and they see only a small part of you.

* Promptness is a sign of respect.

* For the best present spend only half the money you think you should, but double the time with them.

* Loan and don't expect it to get it back. Borrow something and return more.

* Ultimately, you can't change others.

* Friendships form via shared context, not shared activities.

## Communication is everything

* Make eye contact.

* Apologize quickly, specifically, sincerely.

* It's not an apology if it comes with an excuse.

* It is not a compliment if it comes with a request.

* Anything you say before the word “but” does not count.

* Criticize in private, praise in public.

* Elevate good behavior rather than punish bad behavior.

* Before speaking ask yourself: Is it true? Is it necessary? Is it kind?

* Speak confidently as if you are right, but listen carefully as if you are wrong.

* A dumb person, who can communicate well, can do much better than a smart person who can't communicate well but it's much easier to improve communication skills than intelligence.

* "Yes and" instead of "No but"

## Productivity is a lie

* Productivity can be a distraction.

* Embrace detours, that's where the lucky breaks happen.

* Efficiency is highly overrated; Goofing off is highly underrated.

* Action often precedes motivation. Don't wait for motivation to come.

* Dolce far niente, the sweetness of doing nothing.

## Never talk about politics and society

* The best a state can do is to slow down deterioration.

* Humans can't govern other humans.

* Homogenous and collectivist societies promote stability through identity. Heterogeneous and individualistic societies promote progress through friction.

* The chances that you live in a bubble is very high. You start to assume that the majority of all people are reasonable and want the same as you do.

* Humanity isn't as advanced as you think. Our societies are fragile.

## Creating stuff

* Understand the 80/20 rule.

* Most people don't care about their job like you do.

* Always try to do things which you are unqualified for.

* Don't be the smartest person in the room.

* When you are stuck, explain your problem to others.

* Don't keep fighting the old; build the new.

* Work is endless, your time is not, so restrict your time working.

* Separate creation from improvement.

* Work to become, not to acquire.

* All of us seek ultimately the approval of others.

* Don't worry how or where you begin.

## Spicy thoughts about software engineering

* Humans shouldn't write code.

* The best line of code is the one not written.

* The second best line of code is the one you can delete.

* Python is only good for a few things.

* SQL is the most important tool at your disposal.

* ORMs are always a mistake.

* Spend more time on the design of parts that are one-way doors. Ideally, try to make more like two-way doors.

* A good architect finds balance between abstraction and the complexity it inherently introduces.

* Sharing code as a library is often the wrong, duplication the right choice. It's better to trade verbosity with flexibility.

* Always start with a monolithic approach.

* It’s quicker to write ten big balls of mud and see where it gets you than try to polish a single turd.

* Don't fall into the trap that one module must be responsible for one thing only, instead it should solve one problem.

* If you don't know what you are doing or even wrong, at least be consistent.

* Keep things that change more often from things that change less often or from the things which are more difficult to change.

* A loosely coupled system is one where you can delete parts without rewriting others.

* Loose coupling is about being able to change your mind without changing too much code.
