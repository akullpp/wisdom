# Whatever works for me at this stage

Read often.

Write down regularly.

Re-evaluate at intervals.

## A little bit of everything

* Take the stairs.

* Actual costs are often twice the listed price.

* Free or used books have the same words as new ones.

* Buy a tourist guidebook to your home town or region.

* Don't wait in line, it's rarely worth it.

* What you do on your bad days matters more than what you do on your good days.

* Balance stability and flexibility. If you are consistent in some things, you can be more flexible with others.

* Copying others is a good way to start but not to end.

* Insurance companies are not on your side.

* The more you give, the more you get.

* Health is the most important asset you have.

* You are what you do, not what you tell or think you are.

* What you consume and spend your time on influences your thoughts and behavior.

* Just getting older is not an achievement.

* That thing that made you weird, could make you great.

* You do easy things to avoid hard things.

* It is easier to change your thinking by changing your behavior than vice versa.

* Restrictions are good, they will give you freedom.

* Read more books.

* Be frugal no matter how much you have.

## About learning

* If you are alive, that means you still have lessons to learn.

* If you don't write it down, you will forget it.

* Your growth as a conscious being is the number of uncomfortable conversations you are willing to have.

* Don't keep making the same mistakes; try to make new mistakes.

## About the importance of continuity

* Consistency is more important than quantity.

* A long game will compound small gains to overcome even big mistakes.

* We tend to overestimate what we can do in a day, and underestimate what we can achieve in a decade.

* Average returns sustained over an above-average period of time yield extraordinary results.

* Focus on directions rather than destinations.

* Good things happen slowly, bad things happen fast.

## How to deal with others

* Forgiveness is not something we do for others; it is a gift to ourselves.

* Hatred is the poison you drink and hope that someone else might die.

* Accept compliments, don't deflect them.

* You can't reason someone who can't reason.

* Being extremely polite to rude people is the best revenge.

* Getting cheated occasionally is a small price, because when you trust, they generally treat you best.

* You see only a small part of another person, and they see only a small part of you.

* Treating a person to a meal never fails.

* Promptness is a sign of respect.

* Don't treat people as bad as they are. Treat them as good as you are.

* For the best present spend only half the money you think you should, but double the time with them.

* Loan and don't expect it to get it back. Borrow something and return more.

* Ultimately, you can't change others.

* Friendships form via shared context not shared activities

## Communication is everything

* Make eye contact.

* Apologize quickly, specifically, sincerely.

* It's not an apology if it comes with an excuse.

* It is not a compliment if it comes with a request.

* Anything you say before the word “but” does not count.

* Criticize in private, praise in public.

* Elevating good behavior rather than punishing bad behavior.

* Is it true? Is it necessary? Is it kind?

* Speak confidently as if you are right, but listen carefully as if you are wrong.

* A dumb person, who can communicate well, can do much better than a smart person who can't communicate well. It's much easier to improve communication skills than intelligence.

* "Yes and" instead of "No but"

## Productivity is a lie

* Productivity is a distraction.

* Embrace detours, that's where the lucky breaks happen.

* Efficiency is highly overrated; Goofing off is highly underrated.

* Dolce far niente, the sweetness of doing nothing.

* Action often precedes motivation.

## Never talk about politics and society

* The best a state can do is to slow down deterioration.

* Humans can't govern other humans.

* Homogenous and collectivist societies promote stability through identity. Heterogeneous and individualistic societies promote progress through friction.

* The chances that you live in a bubble is very high. You start to assume that the majority of all people are reasonable and want the same as you do.

* Humanity isn't as advanced as you think. Our societies are very fragile.

## Creating stuff

* Understand the 80/20 rule.

* 90% of all people do a bad job.

* Create more leaders, not more followers.

* Do things you are unqualified for.

* When you are stuck, explain your problem to others.

* Don't be the smartest person in the room.

* Don't fighting the old; build the new.

* Work is endless, your time is not, so restrict your time working.

* Separate creation from improvement.

* Work to become, not to acquire.

* All of us seek ultimately the approval of others.

* Don't worry how or where you begin.

## Spicy thoughts about software engineering

* Humans shouldn't write code.

* The best line of code is the one not written.

* Python is only good for a few things.

* SQL is the most important tool at your disposal.

* ORMs are always a mistake.

* Spend time on the design of parts that are one-way doors, i.e. harder to change. Ideally, try to make more like two-way doors, i.e. easier to change.

* A good architect finds balance between abstraction and the complexity it introduces, e.g. via indirection.
